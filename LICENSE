1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
   list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
   this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
   and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its
   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from
   this software without specific prior written permission.

4. Except as explicitly set forth herein, users are permitted broad latitude and flexibility under this license, including the rights to modify, use, and redistribute the software in accordance with the terms above. In particular, except as limited by subsequent clauses, users may engage in rebranding, modification, and redistribution for any purpose, subject to compliance with all other license terms.

5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as a specific and material condition for the exercise of any rights granted under this license for deployments or distributions in which the *aggregate number of end users* (meaning natural persons who directly interact with the application, whether internally or externally) **exceeds fifty (50)** during any rolling thirty (30) day period, you shall neither remove nor obscure any "Open WebUI" branding, inclusive of, but not limited to, the name, logo, or any visual, textual, or symbolic assets that serve to brand the product or its interfaces.

   a. For deployments or distributions with an aggregate user count of fifty (50) or fewer as defined above, this branding requirement does not apply and licensees retain rights to alter, remove, or replace such branding at their discretion, consistent with the above terms.

   b. Any forks or derivative works created prior to the date on which this clause was first incorporated into this license are hereby exempted and “grandfathered” from this provision; provided, however, that such exemption shall cease to apply immediately upon the merging or incorporation of any subsequent code changes, updates, or modifications from this repository that either add, modify, or otherwise affect the scope or application of this branding clause.

   c. For deployments or distributions not meeting the above user threshold but who wish to exceed such limit while removing or altering "Open WebUI" branding, the following exceptions apply: (i) you must obtain an *enterprise license* from the copyright holder; or (ii) you must be a contributor to the codebase with express written permission from the copyright holder. For purposes of this clause, “contribution” shall mean any substantive code change authored by you that has been successfully merged into the main branch of the official codebase maintained by the copyright holder. Where you are a contributor as thus defined, it shall be presumptively understood—subject at all times to verification at the discretion of the copyright holder—that you may possess the written permission necessary to adjust branding as described herein; however, the ultimate responsibility to directly confirm the existence and scope of such permission with the copyright holder remains solely yours, and no removal or alteration of any branding assets shall occur absent such confirmation. When in doubt as to your eligibility regarding branding modification rights as an enterprise user or contributor, you are encouraged to contact hello@openwebui.com for confirmation and guidance.

   d. These requirements apply solely with respect to the preservation of "Open WebUI" branding as described above. For all other aspects, including but not limited to redistribution, modification, and non-endorsement, the terms of the existing license shall control.

   e. If you do not alter, remove, or modify any "Open WebUI" branding, you may otherwise exercise all rights and privileges assigned under this license, irrespective of user count.

   f. The copyright holder expressly reserves the right, in its sole and unfettered discretion, to revise or amend the branding clause set forth herein at any time, for any reason, with such amendments taking effect upon publication or notification as determined by the copyright holder.
